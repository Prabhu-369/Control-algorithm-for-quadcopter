# Control-algorithm-for-quadcopter

PID controller, Nonlinear dynamic inversion controller based on euler angles and body rates controller code for quadrotor are provided.

Refer : Chapter3_NDI_quad.pdf for derivation

Also refer : https://github.com/Prabhu-369/Quadcopter_6DOF_Matlab_files.git for 6dof derivation

Usage: call main function in matlab and the simulation would run.

The code is modularised,anyone can make use of individual functions as well
