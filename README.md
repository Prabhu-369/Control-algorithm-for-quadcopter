# Control-algorithm-for-quadcopter

PID controller, Nonlinear dynamic inversion controller based on euler angles and body rates controller code for quadrotor are provided.

Refer : Chapter3_NDI_quad.pdf for derivation

6dof derivation : https://github.com/Prabhu-369/Quadcopter_6DOF_Matlab_files.git 

Usage: call main function in matlab and the simulation would run.

IEEE paper link: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7495504

Important note: Equation 3.15 in the pdf has sign problem. Kindly refer RotMat_derv.m file for correct equation. 



The code is modularised,anyone can make use of individual functions in their project.

""" The code files and the document is part of my master thesis. Please make use of it constructively """
