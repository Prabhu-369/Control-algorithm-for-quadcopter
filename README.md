# Nonlinear-Dynamic-Inversion-algorithm-for-quadcopter

Refer : Chapter3_NDI_quad.pdf for derivation

Also refer : https://github.com/Prabhu-369/Quadcopter_6DOF_Matlab_files.git for 6dof dervation


Usage: call main function in matlab and the simulation would run.

The code is modularised, if needed anyone can make use of individual functions
